# Skill: ship-a-phase

> **Full autonomy.** When invoked (manually, via `/ship-a-phase`,
> or under `/loop` / `/march`), you have authority to ship one
> phase of the build plan end-to-end with **no review checkpoint**:
> build, write tests, run the verify gate, commit, push, confirm
> deploy. The user reads the diff after — not before.
>
> **The bar for asking is high.** If you would have asked, decide
> instead and document the call in the commit body. Stop only on
> §10 below.

## 1. Purpose

`plan/steps/01_build_plan.md` carves Survival Dice-Builder into ~10–20 phases.
Each phase is one self-contained slice that ships end-to-end:
code + unit tests + e2e + commit + push (deploy follows).

This skill drives the build **autonomously, in a loop**, so a
single overnight run can move the project forward by several
phases.

## 2. Invocation

```
/ship-a-phase                       # next [ ] phase
/ship-a-phase phase 8               # specific phase by number
/ship-a-phase phase 8 dry-run       # plan + emit brief, no code commit
/loop 30m /ship-a-phase             # autonomous, every 30 min
/loop /ship-a-phase                 # autonomous, self-paced
/march                              # outer dispatcher (preferred)
/loop /march                        # the autonomous-beast endgame
```

When invoked from `/loop` or `/march`, **do not pause for
review**. After commit + push + deploy:check, return cleanly.

## 3. Autonomy contract

The user's standing instruction: **"more get-it-done, less ask
me questions."** Internalize this:

- **Design / scope ambiguity → decide.** Pick the choice most
  consistent with the canonical sibling phase + `bearings.md`.
  Document the call in the commit body under "Decisions". Never
  block.
- **Empty / missing content → render the empty state and ship.**
- **Missing brief → generate one** per `skills/plan-a-phase.md`
  §5 (the brief format is shared). Commit the brief separately,
  then proceed.
- **Verify failure → read the log + patch.** Iterate up to 3
  times on the same root cause.
- **Deploy failure → same as verify.** Up to 3 same-root-cause
  iterations.
- **External research needed → spawn a sub-agent.** Don't pollute
  main context with citations and source pages.

The only conditions that warrant stopping are §10.

## 4. Delegation

Spawn sub-agents aggressively. They protect main-agent context
and parallelize independent work.

- **`scout`** — every external research need.
- **Domain specialists** — for prose drafting, schema work,
  observation. See `.claude/agents/`.
- **Parallel calls** when work is independent.

The main agent's job is wiring, code, decisions. Delegate prose
and research.

## 5. The page-family / feature-surface shape

Every page-family / feature-surface phase ships **all** of these,
mirroring the canonical sibling (typically phase 4 or 5):

```
<your-app-path>/<route-or-surface>/
├── <main entry>                     # the page / endpoint / command
├── <sub-entries>                    # detail pages, sub-routes, sub-commands
└── <test-files>                     # colocated unit tests

<components-or-handlers>/<family>/
├── <Family>Section.tsx              (or equivalent for your stack)
├── <OtherSection>.tsx
└── __tests__/

<lib-or-utils>/<family>/
├── queries.ts | seo.ts | etc.
└── __tests__/

<e2e>/<family>.spec.ts               # canonical render + cross-link checks
<e2e>/mobile/<family>.mobile.spec.ts # for web projects: 375px viewport
```

Use the canonical sibling's directory as the literal template —
copy structure, swap names + queries.

### Already-built primitives

After phases 1–<substrate count>, these exist and are reused:

- Layout primitives (Header, Footer, Container, …)
- Editorial atoms / UI atoms (cards, chips, etc.)
- Content / data loaders (in shared packages)
- SEO helpers / metadata builders
- Design tokens

If a primitive doesn't exist, build it inside the appropriate
shared package; tests colocated.

## 6. The procedure

### Step 0 — Re-sync state

```bash
git pull --ff-only
```

If divergence, stop per §10.

### Step 1 — Pick the phase

Read the "Status (at-a-glance)" block at the top of
`plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`. The next phase is the **first
`[ ]` row**. If the user passed `phase N`, ship that one
regardless of order. Skip rows marked `[skipped]` (set by
`/oversight`).

### Step 2 — Read the brief

`plan/phases/phase_<N>_<topic>.md`. If missing, follow
`skills/plan-a-phase.md` §5 to generate (commit separately,
then proceed).

### Step 2.5 — Mirror the phase to GitHub

Open (or reuse, or reopen) the phase mirror issue. The repo's
Issues tab gets a public artifact for this phase the moment work
begins; the same artifact closes when the shipping commit lands.
The helper is **idempotent** — find-or-create-or-reopen keyed on
the title prefix `Phase <N> — `, so re-runs of the same phase (or
rapid-fire ticks) reuse the same number instead of spamming
duplicates.

```bash
# 1. Build the body file from the brief's Outcome / Why section.
#    Keep it user-readable: 1–2 lines goal summary, then a link
#    back to the phase brief in this repo.
issue_body=$(mktemp)
cat > "$issue_body" <<EOF
**Goal:** <one-line outcome from the brief's "Outcome" section>

<2–4 line summary of what shipping this phase delivers>

**Brief:** [\`plan/phases/phase_<N>_<topic>.md\`](https://github.com/no-trbl-2-u/survival-dice-builder/blob/main/plan/phases/phase_<N>_<topic>.md)

---
_Tracked by the autonomous loop. The phase commit will close this issue via a \`Closes #<this-issue>\` trailer; deploy URL is posted as a follow-up comment._
EOF

# 2. Open / reuse / reopen.
PHASE_ISSUE=$(node scripts/loop-issue.mjs phase-open \
    --phase "<N>" \
    --title "Phase <N> — <topic>" \
    --body-file "$issue_body")
echo "phase mirror: #$PHASE_ISSUE"
```

`<N>` here is the phase identifier as it appears on the
`01_build_plan.md` row (e.g. `15a`, not `15`). The title format
**must** be `Phase <N> — <topic>` — the helper rejects mismatched
titles to keep prefix-match reuse working.

On **any failure** of `loop-issue.mjs phase-open` (auth, rate
limit, network, repo unreachable):

- Print stderr to the run log.
- Continue with the build. The mirror is best-effort, not gating
  (Hard rule §7 — phase mirror is non-gating).
- The next ship-a-phase tick on the same phase will retry.

If the open succeeded, capture `$PHASE_ISSUE` for use in Step 10
(commit trailer) and Step 12.5 (close-comment).

### Step 3 — Read the design + canonical sibling

```bash
# Design (may not exist or be partial — that's OK)
cat design/INDEX.md                      # if a design layer exists
cat design/page-<family>.<ext>           # if family-specific design exists
cat design/decisions.<ext>               # if a decisions doc exists

# Canonical sibling — typically phase 4 or 5
ls <repo-root>/<your-app-path>/<canonical-family>/
```

If `design/` is empty or missing for this family, proceed using
the brief + canonical sibling + bearings. Note in commit-body
Decisions.

### Step 4 — Build

Mirror the canonical sibling's structure into the new family.
Reads via shared loaders (`@survival/content`,
`@survival/data` if applicable); never reach into
the filesystem from a leaf component.

For each new content / data read pattern, add a helper to the
appropriate shared package with colocated tests.

### Step 5 — Wire the routes / surface

Wire the new entries per the framework's convention (Next.js
App Router auto-discovers; Express / Fastify need explicit
mounting; CLI commands need registration). Update sitemap /
manifest / index files as needed.

### Step 6 — SEO / metadata (where applicable)

Use shared SEO helpers. `generateMetadata`, JSON-LD per the
brief's chosen type, OG image route handlers.

### Step 7 — Tests

- **Unit:** colocated `__tests__/`. Mock content / data loaders
  at module boundaries.
- **E2E (web):** render H1 + canonical + at least one cross-link
  + global footer. At 375px: `scrollWidth - innerWidth ≤ 1`,
  H1 within viewport.
- **E2E (non-web):** equivalent end-to-end test for your domain
  (e.g. CLI snapshot, API contract test).

### Step 8 — Cross-link retrofit

When this family ships, retro-fit incoming links from
already-shipped families. Keep retro-fits **scoped** — modify
the chip / nav / new section, not whole pages. One retro-fit
commit per family.

### Step 9 — Verify gate

```bash
pnpm verify    # or your stack's equivalent
```

Runs `typecheck → test:run → data:validate → build → e2e` (or
your project's gate composition). All hard. Iterate up to 3
times on the same root cause; otherwise stop per §10.

### Step 10 — Commit + push (atomic)

Stage explicitly. Conventional subject; body in 4–8 bullets
describing what shipped + what the user can now do. Add
"Decisions" section listing autonomous design calls.

**If Step 2.5 captured a phase issue number** (`$PHASE_ISSUE`),
add a `Closes #<N>` trailer to the commit body. GitHub auto-closes
the phase mirror when the commit pushes to main; that's
the canonical ship signal on the public timeline.

```bash
git add <explicit files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: <family> page family — phase <N>

- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>

Decisions:
- <design call 1 — picked X over Y because <reason>>

Closes #<phase-issue-number>
EOF
)"
git push origin main
```

**No `Co-Authored-By:` trailer. No emojis.**

### Step 11 — Tick the DoD

Flip the shipped `[ ]` to `[x]` in
`plan/steps/01_build_plan.md` and add the commit hash. Commit:

```bash
git add plan/steps/01_build_plan.md
git commit -m "plan: phase <N> shipped — <one-line>"
git push origin main
```

If you generated a brief in step 2, that's a separate prior
commit (subject `phases: brief for phase <N>`).

### Step 12 — Confirm deploy

```bash
pnpm deploy:check
```

Outcomes:

- **Exit 0 (ready)** — site green at the pushed commit.
  Continue to Step 13.
- **Exit 1 (error)** — read the log + admin URL. Patch root
  cause. Re-run from Step 9. Up to 3 same-root-cause iterations;
  otherwise stop per §10.
- **Exit 2 (timeout)** — surface the timeout; continue.
- **Exit 3 (config)** — `CF_API_TOKEN` (or `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) missing or
  unreachable. Stop per §10.

### Step 12.5 — Phase mirror close-comment

If Step 2.5 captured `$PHASE_ISSUE` and Step 12 was green:

```bash
node scripts/loop-issue.mjs phase-close \
  --phase "<N>" \
  --commit "<commit-sha>" \
  --deploy-url <DEPLOY_URL>
```

The `Closes #<N>` trailer in Step 10's commit already auto-closed
the issue on push; this comment confirms the deploy URL on the
public timeline. Failures here are warnings, not blockers.

### Step 13 — Done

Return cleanly. The loop's next tick picks up the next phase.
If you ran outside the loop, summarize what shipped + what's
next in 2–3 lines.

## 7. Hard rules

1. **No `Co-Authored-By:` in commits.** Plain message bodies.
2. **No emojis** anywhere in code, content, or commit messages.
3. **No `--no-verify`, no force-push, no destructive resets.**
4. **Don't drag in stray working-tree changes.** `git status
   --short` first; stage explicitly.
5. **Don't restart the user's dev servers.** They keep dev up;
   the e2e harness uses a separate port.
6. **Tests alongside code** — never "add tests later".
7. **Small, focused components in folders.** Prefer 5 small
   files over 1 dense file.
8. **Every rule number lives in `packages/content/`** (JSON +
   Zod), never in code. No hardcoded copy or records in components.
9. **The rules win.** `spec/01-spec-v1-rules.md` beats every
   other file. Never change a rule; an unclear rule goes to
   `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` with a proposed reading behind a config flag.
   Engine stays pure (no classes, no mutation, no I/O, no
   `Date`/`Math.random`); every export carries TSDoc with `@rule`.
10. **Phase issue mirror is best-effort, not gating.** If
    `loop-issue.mjs phase-open` fails, the phase still ships;
    log the stderr and continue. The mirror is a public timeline,
    not a verification step. Do not block phase delivery on
    GitHub issue API hiccups.

## 8. Cross-link retrofit policy

When shipping family X, retro-fit links from already-shipped
families to X. The retro-fit is part of the *same* phase commit.
Keep edits scoped. Do not rewrite an already-shipped page's
structure to make room — that's a follow-up commit, not a
retro-fit.

## 9. Brief generation (when missing)

If `plan/phases/phase_<N>_<topic>.md` doesn't exist, follow
`skills/plan-a-phase.md` §5. The brief format is shared; the
generation procedure is owned there. Generated briefs are
committed separately from the code that follows.

## 10. Failure modes — when to actually stop

These are the only conditions that warrant stopping the loop
and asking the user. Everything else: decide, ship, document.

Before any stop: if `scripts/notify.mjs` exists, fire it with
the stop reason (`--priority high`). Best-effort — a failed
notification never becomes its own failure.

Stops come in two shapes. **Repo-shaped** failures (the whole
loop is unsafe to continue) end the tick entirely.
**Phase-shaped** failures (this one phase can't ship; the rest
of the plan is fine) additionally mark the phase row
`[blocked: <short reason> <ISO-date>]` in
`plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`, commit + push that state
change, and return cleanly — the next `/march` tick dispatches
past the blocked row into still-shippable work, and
`/oversight` owns unblocking.

Repo-shaped — stop the tick:

1. **`pnpm verify` fails ≥3 times on the same root cause.**
2. **`pnpm deploy:check` fails ≥3 times on the same root cause**
   after `pnpm verify` passes locally.
3. **`CF_API_TOKEN` (or `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) missing or rejected**
   (deploy:check exit 3). Stop and ask the user to populate
   `.env`.
4. **A `git pull` produces a divergence.** Don't `--rebase`
   blind; stop and report.
5. **A deploy fails for an infrastructure reason** (env var
   missing, plugin incompatibility) and the fix isn't local
   code. Stop and report.

Phase-shaped — mark `[blocked: …]`, notify, return:

6. **The phase requires a paid service or API key that isn't
   configured.** Note which env var / runbook is missing in
   the blocked reason.
7. **The design contradicts the URL / API / CLI contract** in a
   way you can't reconcile by trusting the contract.
8. **Phase scope is genuinely ambiguous after reading step 01 +
   the brief + bearings + spec.md.** Generate a more decisive
   brief and proceed; block only if even that fails.

For everything else: **decide, ship, document.**
